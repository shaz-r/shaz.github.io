I've come to realise I really don't value it as much as those around me. It's made me realise how differently we all treat it, and it varies from one extreme to the other; and many landing somewhere in the middle.

One end of the spectrum entails "Mr. Scrooge" - the penny pinchers; those who watch over their income and expenditures like a hawk. They cut out discount coupons, get there at 5am for the boxing day sales, rack up the miles and use them.

The other end is "Mr. Spender" - they spend whatever they have on whatever they feel like getting at that specific moment in time. They do find themselves in debt quite a lot, starting a credit card ponzi scheme and putting forward a lifestyle they can barely sustain.

The interesting bit with these observations is how the perceptions shift with income. It's incredibly easy to understand someone with a low income precariously counting their penny, the same way its incredibly easy to imagine someone with a high income being a big spender. More negatively portrayed are those that are opposites; such as a high earner who also happens to be quite tight-fisted, or someone on a low income who's living a life they can't sustain or afford.

And so, a little note for myself: Keep the credit cards at bay, spend what you can afford while pursuing your dreams, keep a little tucked away for a rainy day but do enjoy what you have as often as you can.
