   <title>AMD Radeon R9 290X on a Mac Pro 3,1 (Early 2008)</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There’s an incredible amount of resources (forums, blogs, articles and whatnot) out there for these early Mac Pro’s, so I figured I’d share my experiences in building a gaming rig out of a 6 year old Mac.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started off with the Mac Pro (3,1 - Early 2008); it came with 4gb of RAM (4 x 1gb), a 320GB hard drive, 2x Quad Core Xeons (2.8GHz) and a good ol’ Radeon X1600XT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First things first - I got myself onto eBay and ordered me the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;8gb of Ram (4 x 2gb - made sure to get the ones with the heatsink on them)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Airport Extreme (BCM94360CD to be exact - has 802.11ac, Bluetooth 4.0 etc)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;480GB OZC ARC100 SSD&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gigabyte Radeon R9 290XOC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first three were a pretty / straightfoward fit. The graphics card, on the otherhand, is a bif of a power hog - so some wiring was required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 6-pin mini pci-e auxillary power ports on the motherboard are intended to provide up to 75W each - some resources state they can give up to 150W / throttle down connections by providing 75W but I’d rather not take that chance. The PCI-Express slots themselves provide 75W each. So I’m at 225W when I use both aux power ports and the power from the slot itself, somewhat shy of 300W needed by the graphics card. Since I’m only using one optical drive, and have a spare Hard Disk spot - I got some wires to have them all going into the graphics card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start with, I got myself a &lt;em&gt;Mac Pro 6-pin (mini pci-e) to 6-pin PCI-e Cable&lt;/em&gt;. This one went straight from my motherboard into my graphics card, no dramas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up was purchasing a &lt;em&gt;Molex extension cable&lt;/em&gt; (30cm worked well) - I plugged it into the 2nd optical drive power and routed it through the underside along all the other wires. If you have an Airport Extreme card - be careful as those antenna wires will easily pop out! It is a really tight squeeze but it does go through that gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should mention that for the 8-pin pci-e input in to the graphics card I am using the provided cable (8-pin to 2x Molex), and in went the power from optical drive to one of the molex’s. I also got a &lt;em&gt;SATA to Molex&lt;/em&gt; cable and a &lt;em&gt;Molex Splitter (1 into 2)&lt;/em&gt;, alongside a &lt;em&gt;Mac Pro 6-pin (mini pci-e) to Molex&lt;/em&gt; cable. The Mac Pro cable was rather odd as it provided a Male molex port (power providers should be female), regardless I also had a Male port from the &lt;em&gt;SATA to Molex&lt;/em&gt; cable (as it was intended to provide power for SATA), so they both went into the splitter and that went into the other available Molex plug on the Graphics Card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those curious - it works like a dream. No drivers were needed for it to run OSX - as you would’ve have read you do loose the bootscreen. I may flash it at some point, but I’m happy right now using Bootcamp on Windows to boot back into OSX and Bootchamp on OSX to boot into Windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up - I’ll write about installing Windows 8.1 and Bootcamp 5 - which technically isn’t supported, but works fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll also throw in pictures of the install next time I open up the Mac on this post.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>(Ghetto) Database Backups</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have a server. I have a database. I want to back it up. I have to figure out a solution that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is (mostly) reliable&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gives me access to backups on the server, at my work computer and the one at home&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Did I mention the time constraint of setting one up?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lo and behold, dropbox to the rescue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yup - there’s a cron job that runs “mongodump” twice a day into a dropbox folder on the server. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which syncs with all my computers, and available on the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total setup time? Less than an hour. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/install?os=lnx&quot;&gt;dropbox linux&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=&quot;https://linux.dropbox.com/packages/dropbox.py&quot;&gt;python&lt;/a&gt; script to autostart/manage your dropbox via the command line.&lt;/p&gt;
