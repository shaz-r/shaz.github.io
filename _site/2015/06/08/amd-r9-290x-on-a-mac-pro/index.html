  <h1 class="post-title">AMD Radeon R9 290X on a Mac Pro 3,1 (Early 2008)</h1>
  <span class="post-date">08 Jun 2015</span>
  <p>There’s an incredible amount of resources (forums, blogs, articles and whatnot) out there for these early Mac Pro’s, so I figured I’d share my experiences in building a gaming rig out of a 6 year old Mac.</p>

<p>I started off with the Mac Pro (3,1 - Early 2008); it came with 4gb of RAM (4 x 1gb), a 320GB hard drive, 2x Quad Core Xeons (2.8GHz) and a good ol’ Radeon X1600XT.</p>

<p>First things first - I got myself onto eBay and ordered me the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>8gb of Ram (4 x 2gb - made sure to get the ones with the heatsink on them)</li>
  <li>Airport Extreme (BCM94360CD to be exact - has 802.11ac, Bluetooth 4.0 etc)</li>
  <li>480GB OZC ARC100 SSD</li>
  <li>Gigabyte Radeon R9 290XOC</li>
</ul>

<p>The first three were a pretty / straightfoward fit. The graphics card, on the otherhand, is a bif of a power hog - so some wiring was required.</p>

<p>The 6-pin mini pci-e auxillary power ports on the motherboard are intended to provide up to 75W each - some resources state they can give up to 150W / throttle down connections by providing 75W but I’d rather not take that chance. The PCI-Express slots themselves provide 75W each. So I’m at 225W when I use both aux power ports and the power from the slot itself, somewhat shy of 300W needed by the graphics card. Since I’m only using one optical drive, and have a spare Hard Disk spot - I got some wires to have them all going into the graphics card.</p>

<p>To start with, I got myself a <em>Mac Pro 6-pin (mini pci-e) to 6-pin PCI-e Cable</em>. This one went straight from my motherboard into my graphics card, no dramas. </p>

<p>Next up was purchasing a <em>Molex extension cable</em> (30cm worked well) - I plugged it into the 2nd optical drive power and routed it through the underside along all the other wires. If you have an Airport Extreme card - be careful as those antenna wires will easily pop out! It is a really tight squeeze but it does go through that gap.</p>

<p>I should mention that for the 8-pin pci-e input in to the graphics card I am using the provided cable (8-pin to 2x Molex), and in went the power from optical drive to one of the molex’s. I also got a <em>SATA to Molex</em> cable and a <em>Molex Splitter (1 into 2)</em>, alongside a <em>Mac Pro 6-pin (mini pci-e) to Molex</em> cable. The Mac Pro cable was rather odd as it provided a Male molex port (power providers should be female), regardless I also had a Male port from the <em>SATA to Molex</em> cable (as it was intended to provide power for SATA), so they both went into the splitter and that went into the other available Molex plug on the Graphics Card.</p>

<p>For those curious - it works like a dream. No drivers were needed for it to run OSX - as you would’ve have read you do loose the bootscreen. I may flash it at some point, but I’m happy right now using Bootcamp on Windows to boot back into OSX and Bootchamp on OSX to boot into Windows.</p>

<p>Next up - I’ll write about installing Windows 8.1 and Bootcamp 5 - which technically isn’t supported, but works fine.</p>

<p>I’ll also throw in pictures of the install next time I open up the Mac on this post.</p>
