Currently the tech genius<sup>\*</sup> at [brosa](http://brosa.com.au), all the way down under.

Briefly at [hytch](http://hytch.io) in Berlin. Much longer at [veneumob](http://www.venuemob.com.au/) as a developer before then.

Mentor at the [#endsv](https://www.gov.uk/government/topical-events/sexual-violence-in-conflict) hackathon.

Somehow built [qreer](http://www.qreer.com) and [not going to uni](http://www.notgoingtouni.co.uk) once upon a time, not that many eons ago.

Scratching my non-existent beard with [laravel](http://laravel.com) and [mongo](http://www.mongodb.org). Dabble with [backbone](http://backbonejs.org), love [coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org).

[King's](http://www.kcl.ac.uk/) alumni, mechanical engineering. 

On a quest to be the next tennis champ<sup>\*\*</sup>, do a pirouette<sup>\*\*\*</sup> without falling over and hit the advanced strength standards over at [exrx](http://www.exrx.net/Testing/WeightLifting/StrengthStandards.html).

_<sup>\*</sup>self-proclaimed title, colleagues may disagree_  
_<sup>\*\*</sup>or atleast get the lost balls down to one every session_  
_<sup>\*\*\*</sup>frankly, touching my knees without bending my knees would suffice_
