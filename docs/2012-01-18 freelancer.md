Looking back over my transition from full-time employment, to homeless and broke, to crazy parties and now a nice balance - I have learnt a thing or two:

1. Budget. It can be brutal, very brutal if you don't have any work lined up. So get your savings in order and plan to be without an income for a minimum of 3 months.
2. Portfolio. Sort your site out. Build up some karma/reputation - you've got Github, HackerNews, StackOverflow, LinkedIn - all places where potential clients can be directed to showcase your awesomeness.
3. Network. Find out who's looking for developers / designers. Many agencies outsource their work, a good relationship with even one can be a lifeline. The karma/reputation? Amazing places to link with like minded people.
4. Ask. Seriously, if you see a business owner struggling with an aspect of their business - offer them your services. Say you can build a better system for them, and back it up with your portfolio. Deliver. They in turn will be very happy to recommend you.
5. Keep strict work hours, and make sure there's little overlap between work and play. Make an effort and prepare/dress for the work time - it gets you mentally prepared to get things done.
6. Being a night owl is fine - but make sure you socialise too. The more time spent indoors in front of a screen, the moodier you will get. Spend time on hobbies and interests.
7. Branch out. Travel. In todays world there should be no problem for you to work for someone 6000 miles away.
8. Communicate. Be reachable, be approachable, and importantly - be open to new ways of working.
9. Schedule. Make sure you're only working on a maximum of 2 projects at a time.
10. Lastly, and most importantly, warn your friends/family/significant other of the transition. Their support can make or break you.

Now if only I can stick to the above...
