##Religion
_February 2012_

Dear People of the World,

There are quite a few religions around, and many ultimate beings that require worshipping. Most carry the same message deep down; be a good person, treat others with respect and try not to mess up too much. If you do, just ask and all will be forgiven.

While religion does bring with it a sense of purpose and fulfilment - don't forget that there are others with vastly differing views to your own. Almost every single person will interpret his or her religious teachings differently, and while it is noble of you to want to show them the "true path", I doubt many want it shown to them - mind you; likely they've got their own to follow.

Every teaching pretty much asks for the judging to be left up to the ultimate being, lest you forget. So let folks make their decisions without stigma, don't belittle them, don't judge them. Let them live their life. You'll find your acceptance (maybe even understanding) of their actions will make both you and them happier. Who knows - a world may come where we live in mutual harmony and respect of each others ideals, rather than hoping to enforce our own.

Yours,

A not-so-religious human.

P.s. What I do is between me and my ultimate being, so bugger off!
