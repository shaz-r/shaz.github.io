##Fisherman, meet businessman.  
_March 2012_

Though there's various versions on the internet - here's how I remember it -

> Beautiful sunny day, as always. Pristine golden sand, waves gently crashing. Warm breeze, it couldn't be more perfect. A relatively successful businessman sitting on the Pier, enjoying a beer. He's worked hard to get here, to be able to enjoy this time. A fisherman pulls in, a handful of large fish in the boat, happily chugging away at his beer. Impressed, the following conversation ensues:
  
> "Big fish! How long did it take to catch those??"  
> "Not long at all!"  
> "Couldn't you stay out longer and catch more??"  
> "But these are more than enough to feed my whole family…"  
> "So what do you spend the rest of your time on??"  
> "I catch these fish in the morning, play with my kids. Nap with my wife in the afternoon and go to the village in the evening - share some drinks with friends, sing, dance through the night!"  
> "But so much wasted time! Surely it makes sense to catch some more and sell them - earn yourself a tidy little profit, make some more money. Maybe even work hard and expand, have a successful business!"  
> "Okay…"  
> "You could with ease be able to earn a lot of money! Hire other fisherman, have them working for you! Live like a king, never have to worry about income. Have lot's of spare time, spend it lazing on the beach. Spend more time with your family and friends. Drink some beers, enjoy the sunset without having a worry in the world!"  
> "…want another beer?"
