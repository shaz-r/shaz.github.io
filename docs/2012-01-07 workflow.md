##Workflow
_January 2012_


A quick summary of what I do when when I get a new project to work on:

1. Have a meeting or two with the client to get a good idea of what they want, and the scale of the project itself.
2. Provide a development contract, with an estimated timeline. Agree on the preliminaries, but make sure they understand the scope of work isn't complete / defined and that your estimates *will* change.
3. Spend some time on wireframing / mockups. Email them to client and arrange meeting.
4. Finalise mockups and with that the Scope of Work. Agree on an updated timeline and payment schedule, and update contract.
5. Either do the designs using the mockups or pass them along to a designer.
6. Work my way from back to front: Server Setup, Database, Backend, Front-end.
7. Provide "beta" access to client, get feedback. Compare to original specs / mockups - let client know if the work is out of scope. 
8. Publish project, offer maintenance agreement.

That's about it, sometimes a project can be a week to two weeks, other times it can be upwards of a year. 

The most important thing is to keep the client updated and in the loop - give and get timely feedback, while managing their expectations.
