##The Future
_April 2012_

It's morning, I'm fast asleep but you've been toiling away all night. You've kept an eye on my sleep patterns, noticed my heart rate and temperature - and have deduced the optimum time to wake me. You already know there are road woks along my route and my motorcycle is low on fuel, and have already taken that into account. It's time. You gently bring on the lights, alter the room temperature, bring in some soft music to wake me. Timed right, I feel refreshed and wander over to the kitchen. A steaming expresso just finishes pouring as I walk over, and sit down on my table. The screen in front of me reminds me about the roadworks, and low fuel - plus also asks if it can order some groceries I'm low on. I have a quick list at the goods needed - and notice something odd; there's a bunch of snacks and beers that I don't normally order. A quick click brings up an appointment on my calendar - two days from now I've ordered a PPV sports game and a couple of friends are coming over. Smart.

After getting dressed, I leave the house and my work computer knows I'm on my way. I arrive, and it's already waiting with a little bit of rescheduling - I've got to see my boss in 5 minutes about project X, shelved over 6 months ago. There's already a printout with the project summary to refresh my memory, which I read as I walk over to the meeting room.

The day goes on, I get a fair bit of work done. I'm feeling like having a steak, and I let my future portable organiser / device (fupod) know. It arranges an appointment for me, and is already working over time, calculating the times, routes, bills and so forth. As I wander into the restaurant, a quick buzz reminds me I promised to call my sister - which I dutifully do while waiting for my food. She's coming for this weekend, and I again let my fupod know. It begins to rearrange my appointments for the weekend, so I get to spend much more time with my sis - fupod offers to purchase some more groceries and arrange a night out for a travelling theatre that's in town, remembering my sisters love for theatre or even pulling it from her social feed.

Back at work, as I'm leaving it lets my home know I'm on my way. Did I mention it's winter? It knows when to kick on the heating so when I walk through the door; its pretty darn comfortable and I can relax and spend some me time. It noticed me playing my guitar, but also picked up that I was practicing basic rhythms and arpeggios. It knows not to disturb me when I've got my creative side going own - typing away on a sheet music creator and playing some new (unheard?) riffs. Another buzz, and it lets me know the gym will be relatively free in about 30 mins if I want to go workout - also pointing out that I haven't done so in some time! 

A workout later, it lets me know I've reached a milestone, and it will up the ante for the next workout. It gets me home, my bedroom's the ideal temperature for sleeping and I dive right in.

Fupod sorts my day out for me without me worrying at all about it. It remembers to do most things I would forget, and plans for the future too. It keeps me healthy, knows what I like and I'd benefit from, and steers me in that direction. Of course, I don't have to do anything it recommends me to, and it would take that into account too. But, if this is the future of technology, you wouldn't get such an integrated assistant and not use it.

All that's left is to see wether it's the industry giants that get us there first. The tech already exists. I'm hoping a bunch of hackers somewhere pull together my social feeds, my calendar, know me from my smartphone and put the above together a relatively low cost.

Project Glass isn't the future. In it's current iteration, it's only an extension of the smart phone; or maybe a step beyond. Could it take us there? Possibly, but they need to start dreaming big - it's time to move beyond just sharing your life with others.
