##Android vs iOS
_October 2012_

A couple of years ago my partner asked me if it's worth getting the iPhone or jump in and try the new Android phones coming to the market.

At that point in time I said, without hesitation - the iPhone. I believe iPhone 4 rumours / part leaks were gathering pace, and my reasoning for the recommendation:

> The iPhone is about 3-4 years ahead of Android - they've got a mature, well featured and well supported ecosystem. Will it hold that lead? I give it 5 years before Android catches up - Google's pace of innovation will be far superior to Apple's, not to mention they've got a product to take inspiration from.

An over-generalisation, and potentially incorrect, but to me Apple takes a product already on the market and fix it up so it's actually easy and enjoyable to use. They jam in features, tie it up with incredible hardware and put a marketing spin that makes you drool over the product. They're not groundbreaking - but they have that attention to detail that none other have.

Once they release that product - they refine it year on year; Macs, MacBooks, iPhones, iPads and the software running on them. iPods would be the exception - every year they throw in something new. 

On the hardware side of things - the pace of development is strong; and the innovations still keep Apple ahead of their competitors (but not by much). On the software side, I'm afraid things are getting pretty stagnant. To me there hasn't been anything new, fresh or ground breaking since the introduction of iOS 4 or OSX 10.5.

You can argue that it's all about the subtle changes, the little things that add up to a big difference - and I don't deny that one bit. Android is the best example - compare Cupcake to Jelly Bean and the difference is astounding, yet they are the same OS, just drilled down and refined. All this was done in 3 years, but Apple has been at it for over 5 years now and should still be miles ahead (having recreated, lead and dominated the market).

Now here's the dilemma - as it stands at this very moment I'm looking to get a phone. A year ago, I would've walked in and gotten an iPhone without hesitation. 

But, and it's a big but, Google [announced](http://googleblog.blogspot.com.au/2012/10/nexus-best-of-google-now-in-three-sizes.html) it's latest Nexus line of devices. Google does maps, search and voice far better than Apple. They're online ecosystem (Play, Docs, Chrome, Photos) is pretty darn good, much better than what MobileMe was and iCloud currently is. They undercut Apple greatly on price.

I've spent over $10,000 in hardware, media and applications over the past couple of years - all straight to Apple. I don't want to jump ship - but I am ready to. Or I was, until Apple [reshuffled](http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2012/10/29Apple-Announces-Changes-to-Increase-Collaboration-Across-Hardware-Software-Services.html) their board.

I think (or hope) they recognised their competitors have caught up to them (and went past on some aspects), and their pace of software development has been letting them down. Yes, they were blindsided by Google (once collaborator now competitor) - but it could have and still can just as easily be Palm / HP or Microsoft. But they've put in charge the people who've done the most for them in keeping them ahead, and removed those that haven't.

So as it stands - Apple know they're falling, and they've taken steps to correct it. Their competitors are making products that are finally on par or better than theirs. And that leaves me in a predicament - stick it out with products that I know and have invested a great deal of time + money in, or make the move.

The next couple of years should be pretty interesting, we've got the giants fighting it out, an ex-champ turned underdog, and a whole slew of hardware manufacturers (desktop, tablet and mobile) with mixed interests. I'm still waiting on my [Fupod](http://shazamjad.com/post/the-future) though.

My partner ended up getting a Samsung Omnia and then an iPhone 4S the following year. I'm likely upgrading to an iPhone 5 soon - the hardware still wins it for me, the software and ecosystem: Google's my favourite now.
