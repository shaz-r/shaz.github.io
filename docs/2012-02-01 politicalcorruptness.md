##Political Corruptness
_February 2012_

Are politicians corrupt? No, I don't think so. 

They have a daunting task of having to appease to a diverse group of people, especially in todays incredibly fluid and multi-cultured world.

This leaves them on a tight-rope, having to balance their own agenda, the direction of their party or peers, the requests of their citizens while ensuring toes aren't tread on and ultimately what they do (or don't) is for the greater good.

Unfortunately for us, it's large corporations / lobby groups that write the cheques to fund their political campaigns, and as such politicians are most likely to give their time to them. We don't really bother our politicians unless something comes up that really gets our back up - but the lobby groups are active year round, constantly barraging our representative with their ideals.

But you know what? Votes count for far more than the money. Stop hoping for the best from your local representative. Get in touch. Talk to him/her. Their office is always open and they do actually listen. If enough of us actively support our representative, make our stand year round - then we'll find the government actively working for us.
