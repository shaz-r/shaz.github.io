##Budget Fare
_January 2012_

We now live in a world where budget travel has allowed an incredible number of people to get to remote destinations they never would have dreamed possible only a decade ago. Funnily enough, there hasn't been any outward advancement in the technology - the airplanes are still the twin turbine engined aluminium tubes, the busses are still giant diesel steel cans clogging up the lanes and the trains are still their mammoth selves, following tracks laid out back during the world wars.

What has changed are the business models. People are willing to be treated a bit worse for wear for an incredibly competitive price. They don't mind being jam packed like sardines into their mode of transport, the hefty fees imposed if they fall foul of the minute terms imposed and nor the lack of compassion or personal judgement shown by those entrusted with the smooth operation of their mode of transport, provided the fare is dirt cheap.

So here's the kicker, a message to the those normal (and now luxury) fare operators. 

Don't panic. 

There's a few generations of people around that remember how inspiring travel was, how good it felt to be able to afford to get somewhere and come back with amazing tales of adventure. These generations hanker for the good ol' days, when you could book a whole train carriage for your family or enjoy a leisurely smoke and drink on an airplane. A time when you would be welcomed through a country's entry point with warm smiles, hot drinks instead of hostile security practices. 

Your time is right around the corner, just tough it out for now. You will find a generation of people willing to pay bit more to be treated like we used to, and you will find a few generations of people who've never experienced the true hospitality that was once the norm.
