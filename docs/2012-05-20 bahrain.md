##I really need to stop diving in the deep end of things
_May 2012_
 
Highlights of my trip to Bahrain (in no particular order):

1. Bahraini's taking a good hour before allowing me into the country!
2. The incoherent laughter about my flight on the ride from the airport (thanks mo!)
3. A picnic in the park that turned into an all out war against the bees. And cramping/pulling my leg muscle. 
4. Power sliding a rental automatic (Sorry Ahmed! It had to be done!)
5. Seeing a Rueda up front, and doing capoeira after such a long time.
5. Playing "Free Love" for Za's birthday.
6. Clubbing in Bahrain. The sausage fest, the drunken assault, the night lasting til 5am. 
7. Getting my hair molested.
8. Learning how to play Fifa from the master himself.
9. Discovering 98 fake hummers. And nearly half as many real ones!
10. Having the breakfast of a lifetime. Or one that would last me approximately 2 days.
11. Disbelief at the price of petrol (Â£15 for 60 liters?!?!). 
12. Discovering Oreo Cake
13. Discovering Kono Pizza
14. THE AVENGERS!!!!!
15. Poking Mona.
16. Inability to play Basketball.
17. Going for the perfect dive, stopping mid-air and falling flat like a board into the pool. Body wouldn't stop stinging for an hour!
18. Embarrassing Ahmed. Annoying Ahmed.
19. Hitting like 4 perfect shots on the driving range. Out of 200.
20. Who the hell thought a full duck was a good idea for a starter? 50% off food. Damn. And the half banana me and Ali shared.
21. Burnt Tyres!

I'm sure there's moments I've completely forgotten to add up there but hey - for having been there just over a week it was one hell of an adventure!

Lots of love to [Ali](https://twitter.com/#!/DesirePeeper), [Fatema](https://twitter.com/#!/fatema_bh), [Jak](https://twitter.com/#!/21pst3r), Za, [Mona](https://twitter.com/#!/phoenixmon) and of course [Ahmed](https://twitter.com/#!/ahmedesbai)! Thanks for having me guys! And of course - ya'all better be planning a pretty epic holiday to come see me in Australia!
