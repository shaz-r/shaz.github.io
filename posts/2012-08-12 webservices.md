##Web Development Tools / Services
_August 2012_

The following is a list of applications that I find my self using all the time:

1. [iMockups](http://www.endloop.ca/imockups/) (iPad) - Excellent to do website mockups / wireframes.
2. [Prompt](http://itun.es/i624Jj) (iPad) - All my coding is done in Vim, ssh-ing into my Mac.
3. [Sequel Pro](http://www.sequelpro.com/) (OSX) - Best MySQL editor by far. If only there was an iPad equivalent. 
4. [Photoshop CS6](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html) (OSX) - Design.
5. [Drop Box](http://www.dropbox.com/) - File sharing.
6. [Google Documents](http://docs.google.com/) - File Collaboration / Bug Tracking / Feature requests / Doc sharing / Time Tracking.
7. [Spotify](http://www.spotify.com/) - Music.
8. Terminal (OSX) - For Vim and everything else.
9. [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/) - Outright speed and Webkit Inspector.
10. [F.lux](http://stereopsis.com/flux/) - Gives the screen a warm tint - try it and never look back.
11. [Pages](http://www.apple.com/iwork/pages/) (OSX) - Only used for it's beautiful invoices, all other text editing is on Vim or Google Docs.

And below are services I always fall back onto for new or existing projects:

1. Domains by [Gandi.net](http://www.gandi.net/) or [1&1](http://www.1and1.co.uk/).
2. DNS through [CloudFlare](http://www.cloudflare.com/).
3. Dedicated Hosting by [Heztner](http://www.hetzner.de/en/), scalable stack on [Amazon AWS](http://aws.amazon.com/), shared hosting on [Gandi](http://www.gandi.net/), and rapid releases on [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/).
4. Site / App email delivery by [Postmark](http://postmarkapp.com/).
5. Newsletters / Campaigns by [MailChimp](http://mailchimp.com/).
6. Emails on [Google Apps for Business](http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/index.html).
7. Load-testing by [Blitz](http://blitz.io/).
8. Analytics by [Google](http://www.google.com/analytics/) & [Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com/).
9. CRM / Support via [Desk](http://www.desk.com/).
10. Payment processors - [Stripe](http://stripe.com/), [Pin](https://pin.net.au/) and [GoCardless](https://gocardless.com/).

The only thing lacking in my list is an easy payment service - some of my invoices are paid via PayPal by clients and I would so greatly love an alternative - something akin to [WePay](https://www.wepay.com/) with international support.
