##The Apple Premium
_February 2012_

Apple. There's the devout lovers, the fan boys, the on-lookers, the slaters and the haters.

Ignoring the market hype befalling a product launch - Apple have consistently, over the last decade, innovated and disrupted entire industries. They've given us the future envisioned a long time ago.

Take an objective view of any Apple product - and the price to specifications ratio is absurd. You could build or buy an equivalent powerhouse or two for the same price. But, and there's a big but - does it make you want to interact with it? to feel it? to actually use it just because you want to instead of you having to?

Here's where Apple win me over - I actually find myself *wanting* to use my iPhone. I *want* to sit in front of the Mac and enjoy the beauty of OSX. I *want* to revel in the simplicity, the ease. I look forward to getting things done, to getting on with my work. I'd feel actual sadness at loosing any of them. It's the whole package, the attention to detail and how it (almost) "just works". It's the care, the love they put into engineering every single part of their product. It's their pursuit of perfection, inside out. It's having the experience of it lasting half a decade after all your abuse, and still humming along with no fuss.

That's why I pay the Apple premium.
