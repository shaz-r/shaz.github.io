##The importance of customer service
_December 2012_

Talking with my friends over dinner - it hit me just how important customer service is. You can have the worst possible product, but provided you back that with half decent support - you will usually be okay.

The conversation itself veered onto an expensive, exotic motorcycle I purchased, which 6 months later set itself on [fire on my driveway](https://twitter.com/i/#!/shazamjad/media/slideshow?url=pic.twitter.com%2FJ5Wx5mF8).

Neither the dealer not the manufacturer made any effort of support, with me having to pay out a fair bit of money just to get the motorcycle moved around and assessed by the original dealer + an independent one.

A simple insurance matter was complicated by the [fire report](http://media.shazamjad.com/lfbg-report.pdf)* suggesting fault lies in the equipment; and as such any insurance payout was effectively nothing and would send my premium rocketing.

Taking the matter to the dealer resulted in nothing but silence, and direct contact with the manufacturer was met with "We can't help you, talk to your local dealer".

The carcass was sold, and a decision made to never purchase a motorcycle from said manufacturer**.

And it goes - they've lost only one customer. Or have they?

The image of the brand was not just tarnished to me, but my friends and family too. We're young, have a high disposable income and could potentially have been customers for life - but there's now a group of folks who are likely to steer potential customers away. So next time someone walks into a dealership looking to make a purchase, they'll always have this in the back of their mind: 

"Triumph? Nah - I remember one guy's caught fire when he bought it brand new. Poor bastard had to sell it off - they told him to go stuff himself when he tried to get it sorted."

Surely this is what you want the customers to be saying:

"Triumph? Dodgy electrics I hear - heard about that guy who's Daytona caught fire? But yeah - they fixed it for him immediately with no hassle, top guys."

\* The fire report has the incorrect vehicle registration - license plate was melted almost entirely, and as such incorrectly states the vehicle as reported lost/stolen. The address is incorrect too - as thats where the fire truck positioned itself.

** I would love to purchase a new triumph. They're beautiful, amazing engines and incredible to ride. But I can't, because I know if it breaks - I'll be short of $15,000 again.
